# Wall Following Robot

As part of a Computer Science module on Intelligent Cognitive & Control Systems I was tasked with building a wall following robot which I then chose to extend and write a conference paper entitled 'Perception through the Eyes of a Wall Following Robot' to conduct research into how perception is affected by a robot's morphology.

You can find the conference paper I wrote using this code [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z914kADJPjwZBHtlsJ4ktcBE_aw68wWa/view?usp=sharing)
